# Wild-And-Domestic-Reindeer-Fennoscandia-Osteometrics
Osteometric and statistical results of Simple Variable Combinations, Mennerich's indices 1 and 3, and iSizes Boxplots of Fennoscandian domestic reindeer, Norwegian wild mountain reindeer, and Finnish forest reindeer.

Our study explores the osteometric separation between modern castrated and male and female domestic reindeer (Rangifer tarandus tarandus), male and female wild mountain reindeer (Rangifer tarandus tarandus), and male and female wild forest reindeer (Rangifer tarandus fennicus), based on postcranial skeletal measurements. 

In this repository, one can find all scatterplot results of our Simple Variable Combinations and Mennerich's (1968) indices 1 and 3, as well as our isometric size (iSize) boxplot results for complete and partial bones.
